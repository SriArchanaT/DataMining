# DataMining
In this assignment, we will conduct a guided exploration over the given dataset.

We will learn and use some of the most common exploration/aggregation/descriptive operations. This should also help us learn most of the key functionalities in Python.

We will also learn how to use visualization libraries to identify patterns in data that will help in your further data analysis. You will also explore most popular chart types and how to use different libraries and styles to make your visualizations more attractive.
